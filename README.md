# Flutter Project Automatisation

This is a simple Python script to make making of my Flutter projects easier. When I make Flutter project I always do the same few steps before starting to actually make mobile app. For example I always make few folders, such as Widgets and Pages, to make my Dart files more organized. After that I usually make an initial run of the app in the iPhone simulator.

So everything I was doing by myself before, now is being done by this script.


## Future plan
In the future I might add some editing of the main.dart file, because that is also the thing I always do in my new Flutter project.


If you want to use my script feel free to do it, you just need to edit the path of folder for your Flutter projects.
