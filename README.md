# Flutter Project Automatisation

This is a simple Python script to make making of my Flutter projects easier. When I make Flutter project I always do the same few steps before starting to actually make mobile app. For example I always make few folders, such as Widgets and Pages, to make my Dart files more organized.

So everything I do by myself before coding a Flutter app, now is being done by this script.
